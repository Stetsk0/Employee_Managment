Created employee management system as my undergraduate project. ASP.NET MVC, EF.

This web application has a login based on Admin and Employee roles. Admin can add, delete employees, edit their personal information, credentials, stats, vacations and penalties. When adding a new employee, Admin creates a password and login for the employee, which are then hashed and added to the database. 

Some screenshots from the admin panel:
